# java-data-structures-and-algorithms
## Intro
The information and code on this repository are based on what I studied in the book Introduction to Algorithms (Third Edition) by Cormen et. all. and 
by content provided by the Udemy course Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java.

### What is a data structure
A data structure is used to organize and store data. Each has strengths and weaknesses.

### What is an Algorithm
An algorithm is a description of the steps required to complete a certain task. An algorithm is not an implementation.

## Big O Notation
The Big O Notation is a way to compare algorithms independently of where the implementations are run. Since different
hardware can process instructions at different speeds, we use the number of steps required to complete an algorithm
as a more objective measure, and we call this time complexity. It is also important to know how much space an algorithm
uses to produce a result, we call that Memory Complexity.

Conventionally, the number of items is designated as n, the time complexity as O(n). Constants don't factor because
they don't determine the growth rate (i.e. they do not change at the increase of the number of elements).

Best to worse
* O(1) -> Constant
* O(log n) -> Logarithmic (base 2)
* O(n) -> Linear time complexity
* O(n log n) -> n log-star n
* O(n^2) -> Quadratic

### Time Complexity
The Time Complexity is the number of steps required to complete an algorithm.

### Memory Complexity
The Memory Complexity is the amount of memory required to complete an algorithm.
